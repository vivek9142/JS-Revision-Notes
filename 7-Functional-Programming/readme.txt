functional programming is all about separation of concerns, which
object oriented programming does as well

It's all about packaging our code into separate chunks so that everything's well organized.
And each part of our code concerns itself with the one thing it's good at.

We remember in our object oriented programming section how we had classes to divide up properties and
methods of, let's say, an ogre from that of an elf.
And functional programming has this idea as well of separating concerns, but they also separate data
and functions.

Now, there is no correct definition for what is and isn't functional, but 
generally functional languages have an emphasis on simplicity where data and 
functions are concerned.

the goals of functional programming are the exact same as that of object oriented programming.
It's the idea to make our code clear and understandable, easy to extend, easy to maintain.
It's going to allow us to not repeat ourselves keeping our code dry and keeping our memory efficient
by having these reusable functions that act on data.

Now, when it comes to functional programming, we have a very important pillar and unlike object oriented
programming where we had those four pillars of encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance,
if you want to break things down and functional programming, it all comes down to this concept of pure
functions.

But the idea here is that there's a separation between data of a program and the behavior of a program.
And all objects created in functional programming are immutable, something that we'll talk about a
little bit more.

But what that means is once something is created, it cannot be changed.
We avoid things like shared state and we adhere to this principle of pure functions.

And as you'll find out, functional programming has a lot of restraints, a lot of rules, things that
you can't do.
